                    <p>is raw, unprocessed facts and figures. It's like the building blocks of information. Think of it as individual pieces of a puzzle, each holding a small part of the bigger picture. By itself, a single piece of data doesn't convey much meaning.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>Data is a collection of facts, numbers, or other information that can be used to analyze, or make decisions. It is generally raw information that simply includes basic numbers or texts. Information is the data that has been organized and analyzed to be useful for decision making. And knowledge is the understanding, awareness, or familiarity gained through experience, education, or learning. It encompasses facts, information, and skills acquired over time.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>The process of turning data into information is called data processing or 
                        data transformation. It involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing raw 
                        data to extract meaningful insights and valuable information. Information is 
                        simply data. But information is transformed into knowledge when the mind assesses 
                        it as valuable enough to use later. </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>Computing fundamentally relies on the binary number system, which employs only two digits: 0 and 1. This simplicity aligns perfectly with the on/off states of electronic circuits, making it the cornerstone of digital technology. While binary is the language computers understand, other number systems are essential for human-computer interaction and efficient data representation.</p>
                    <p>Binary numbers, while fundamental to computer operations, can be cumbersome for humans to read and write due to their length. To address this, octal and hexadecimal number systems are employed. These systems offer more compact representations of binary numbers, making them easier to work with. Hexadecimal, in particular, is widely used for representing memory addresses and color codes due to its efficiency in representing large binary values. Additionally, both hexadecimal and octal can aid in debugging and analyzing low-level system issues by providing a more human-readable view of binary data.</p>
                    <p>While computers operate on binary numbers, understanding these other number systems is crucial for programmers, system administrators, and anyone working with digital technology. By mastering these systems, we can bridge the gap between human intuition and the machine language of computers.</p>

It enables devices to store, access and manipulate all types of information directed to and from the CPU or memory. It allows computers to store and manipulate data using a system of switches that can be turned on or off, represented by the digits 0 and 1 . This binary code can represent any type of data, from text and numbers to images and sound. Computers don't understand human language and some of us don't understand computer language, so converting it can make us both the computer and the users understand each other’s needs.
