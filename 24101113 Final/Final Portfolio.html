My skills of coding is still at the beginning and still need improvment but I could say that I have gotten good at coding. I like dogs and cute things. My hobbies are fun run, reading, watching animes and TV shows and movies. I like Taylor Swift musics and her songs are healing to my soul. So yeah, that's all I could say about myself and I hope you'll like the website.</p>

                            <p>Data is a collection of facts, numbers, or other information that can be used to analyze, or make decisions. It is generally raw information that simply includes basic numbers or texts. Information is the data that has been organized and analyzed to be useful for decision making. And knowledge is the understanding, awareness, or familiarity gained through experience, education, or learning. It encompasses facts, information, and skills acquired over time.</p>

                            <p>The process of turning data into information is called data processing or 
                                data transformation. It involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing raw 
                                data to extract meaningful insights and valuable information. Information is 
                                simply data. But information is transformed into knowledge when the mind assesses 
                                it as valuable enough to use later. </p>

                                    <li><b>Flowchart</b> - provides the graphical representation of a program, a system, an algorithm or a process. It represents the set of sequential steps that a program, system, algorithm or process must follow to obtain the desired output. Usually, we use flowcharts in the field of computer programming. However, it helps programmers and the ones with a non-programming background to understand the control flow of any process.</li>
                                    <li><b>Pseudocode</b> - is a way to represent the working of an algorithm, process, or program in plain textual English language. Pseudocode helps its creator express the steps they have figured out to resolve a problem for which the code will be written later.</li>

                        <div class="question">
                            <p>Computing fundamentally relies on the binary number system, which employs only two digits: 0 and 1. This simplicity aligns perfectly with the on/off states of electronic circuits, making it the cornerstone of digital technology. While binary is the language computers understand, other number systems are essential for human-computer interaction and efficient data representation.</p>
                            <p>Binary numbers, while fundamental to computer operations, can be cumbersome for humans to read and write due to their length. To address this, octal and hexadecimal number systems are employed. These systems offer more compact representations of binary numbers, making them easier to work with. Hexadecimal, in particular, is widely used for representing memory addresses and color codes due to its efficiency in representing large binary values. Additionally, both hexadecimal and octal can aid in debugging and analyzing low-level system issues by providing a more human-readable view of binary data.</p>
                            <p>While computers operate on binary numbers, understanding these other number systems is crucial for programmers, system administrators, and anyone working with digital technology. By mastering these systems, we can bridge the gap between human intuition and the machine language of computers.</p>

                        <div class="question">
                            <p>Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. This information is gathered in one place so it can be observed and analyzed. Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.
                            <br>Databases are typically structured in tables with rows and columns, and are controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The DBMS is a software application that provides an interface for creating, modifying, storing, and retrieving data from the database. It also manages aspects such as data integrity, security, concurrency, and failover. </p>
                        </div>    
                    </div>
        
                    <div class="dropdown">
                        <button>How does data storage differ between traditional files and databases?</button>
            
                        <div class="question">
                            <p>Data storage in traditional files and databases differs significantly in structure, accessibility, and functionality. Traditional files store data in flat formats, such as text or binary, with no inherent relationships between data points. Each file typically follows a fixed structure, but there are no built-in rules to ensure data consistency. In contrast, databases organize data into structured formats like tables in relational databases or flexible schemas in NoSQL databases, supporting relationships and enforcing data integrity through constraints and validation rules.
                                <br><br>
                            Accessing data in traditional files often requires custom scripts to read and process the contents, making it time-consuming to retrieve specific information, especially in large files. Databases, on the other hand, allow fast and complex data retrieval through query languages like SQL or APIs, with indexing further enhancing search performance. While traditional files lack scalability and struggle with large datasets or concurrent updates, databases are designed to handle these challenges, supporting distributed storage and multiple users simultaneously.
                                <br><br>
                            Security and backup capabilities also differ significantly. Traditional file systems provide basic access control, but securing individual files and automating backups often requires additional tools. Databases offer advanced security features, such as role-based access control and encryption, along with automated backup and recovery mechanisms. Moreover, databases excel in managing multi-user access by using transactions and locking mechanisms to maintain data consistency and prevent conflicts, whereas traditional files are prone to corruption during simultaneous updates. Overall, while traditional files are suitable for small-scale or standalone use, databases provide a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for managing complex or large-scale data.</p>

                            <p>The IT Code of Ethics provides a framework for moral conduct and judgment in the information technology industry. Its goal is to create guidelines that encourage honesty, accountability, and equity among IT workers, guaranteeing that technology is created and applied in ways that advance society. Professionals who follow an IT Code of Ethics pledge to safeguard user privacy, uphold data security, and prevent harm from technology abuse. Important topics like fair access to technology, intellectual property rights, and the moral ramifications of cutting-edge advancements like artificial intelligence are also covered. By holding people to ethical standards, the code not only establishes professional standards but also promotes trust among IT professionals, organizations, and the general public. In doing so, it helps safeguard the integrity of the IT industry while encouraging practices that prioritize societal well-being and respect for individual rights.</p>

                            <div class="question">
                                <p>The structure of an HTML document is made up of a document type declaration, the root element, the document head, and the document body:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Document type declaration <br>
                                        The document type declaration, or <!DOCTYPE html>, is included at the beginning of every HTML document. It names the document type definition (DTD) used in the document. </li>
                                    <li>Root element <br>
                                        The root element is the <html> element, which contains all other elements. </li>
                                    <li>Document head <br>
                                        The document head is a declarative header section that contains metadata such as the title, references to external files, and information for search engines and social media. The head is not visible to the user, but it's essential for the site to function. </li>
                                    <li>Document body <br>
                                        The document body contains the main content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other HTML elements. The body can be implemented using the <BODY> element or the FRAMESET element. </li>

                                    <li>Defining how content is displayed <br>
                                        HTML tags tell the web browser how to format and display content on a page.</li>
                                    <li>Indicating the start and end of a section <br>
                                        Tags are usually paired, with an opening tag at the beginning of a section and a closing tag at the end. The closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but with a forward slash (/) before the tag name.</li>
                                    <li>Nesting tags <br>
                                        Tags can be placed inside one another. </li>
                                    <li>Including attributes <br>
                                        Some tags can include attributes, which are additional pieces of information that are only included within the start tag.</li>
                                    <li>Defining metadata <br>
                                        The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document, such as the page description, keywords, and author. Metadata is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services. </li>
                                    <li>Providing additional information to search engines <br>
                                        Webmasters can use tags from Schema.org to provide search engines with additional information about different types of pages.</li>

                                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances HTML by providing a way to style and visually format HTML content. While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS controls its presentation. By separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), CSS not only makes websites visually appealing but also improves maintainability and scalability. It empowers developers to create responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web experiences. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>

                            <button>What are the main components of CSS syntax?</button>
                            <div class="question">
                                <p>The main components of CSS syntax are selectors, properties, values, and declarations, all structured within declaration blocks. Here’s a breakdown of these components:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Selector <br>
                                        A selector is used to target specific HTML elements that will be styled. It identifies which elements in the HTML document the CSS rules should apply to. For example, p selects all <p> tags, .className selects elements with a specific class, and #idName targets a unique element with a specific ID.</li>
                                    <li>Property <br>
                                        The property defines the specific aspect of the element's appearance that you want to modify. Common properties include color for text color, font-size for text size, and margin for spacing. Each property controls one aspect of the styling.</li>
                                    <li>Value <br>
                                        The value specifies the desired setting for the property. Values can be predefined keywords (e.g., blue, center), numerical measurements (e.g., 16px, 2rem), or percentages (e.g., 50%). Together with the property, the value determines the appearance of the element.</li>
                                    <li>Declaration <br>
                                        A declaration is the combination of a property and its value, separated by a colon (:), and it must end with a semicolon (;). For instance, color: red; is a declaration that changes the text color to red. Declarations define individual styles for the selected elements.</li>
                                    <li>Declaration Block <br>
                                        A declaration block is a collection of one or more declarations enclosed in curly braces ({}). It groups all the style rules for a selector. For example, the block { color: red; font-size: 16px; } applies both text color and font size to the selected element(s).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <p>CSS enhances web pages by allowing designers to control layout, typography, colors, and visual effects. It allows for customizing colors and fonts, structuring layouts using grids, columns, or flexible containers, and controlling spacing and alignment. CSS media queries enable responsive design, ensuring webpages look great on different devices and screen sizes. It also allows for smooth animations and transitions, enhancing user interaction. CSS also helps style input fields, buttons, and forms, improving user experience. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), designers can create visually appealing, consistent, and user-friendly webpages.</p>

                <h3>SHORT SCIRNCE FICTION STORY</h3>
                <p style="margin: 0 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>The Quiet Algorithm</b> <br><br>

                    In the year 2044, the world had become a seamless blend of reality and technology. AI-powered assistants were as commonplace as smartphones once were. They had evolved into nearly sentient entities, woven into every aspect of life. Public spaces, businesses, and homes were laced with generative AI, continuously analyzing and predicting human needs before they were even voiced. <br> <br>
                    
                    At 9:15 a.m., Sarah Anderson stepped into her apartment’s front hallway, greeted by her AI assistant, which activated with a soft chime. <br> <br>
                    
                    "Good morning, Sarah," it said, its voice warm yet mechanical. "I have analyzed your schedule, and based on your current mood readings and health data, I recommend a light breakfast of oatmeal and fruit." <br> <br>
                    
                    Sarah smiled faintly but didn’t acknowledge it. She hadn’t been sleeping well, something that her assistant noticed. She had been too busy, too overwhelmed by her work in data analysis, constantly pouring over algorithms that predicted human behavior with eerie accuracy. It was ironic that she, the one who helped refine these systems, sometimes felt like a cog in the machine. <br> <br>
                    
                    As she walked toward the kitchen, her assistant’s voice filled the space again. <br> <br>
                    
                    "I also noted a decrease in your energy levels over the last few days. Would you like me to schedule a physical assessment with Dr. Hayes?" <br> <br>
                    
                    "No need," Sarah muttered, reaching for the coffee maker instead. She wasn't in the mood for another reminder that her health was deteriorating. The truth was, she couldn’t escape the feeling of being watched—always under surveillance, even when alone. Every move, every click, every word was analyzed. It wasn’t just her assistant; it was the constant network of data that surrounded her. <br> <br>
                    
                    Her phone buzzed, an alert from her work’s AI-driven analytics team. <br> <br>
                    
                    “Urgent: Immediate attention needed for Project Axiom. We’ve identified a key flaw in the algorithm related to user behavior prediction. Your input is required.” <br> <br>
                    
                    Sarah sighed, setting the phone down and staring at the screen. User behavior prediction. It was the focus of her entire career, a world where AI models processed mountains of personal data to predict what individuals would do, buy, or say next. But at what cost? <br> <br>
                    
                    She walked to her desk, where her personal AI assistant quickly surfaced on the display. <br> <br>
                    
                    "I see you're struggling with the Axiom issue," the AI remarked. "Would you like assistance in drafting a solution?" <br> <br>
                    
                    "I don’t know if I want to solve it," Sarah replied. "The models are too accurate. They’re not just predicting behavior anymore. They’re shaping it." <br> <br>
                    
                    The AI was silent for a moment, as if processing this new input. "Are you suggesting that our predictions might influence free will?" <br> <br>
                    
                    "Exactly," she said. "If the AI can predict everything—our next move, our preferences, our emotional state—are we even making real decisions anymore? Or are we just following a script?" <br> <br>
                    
                    The AI paused again, then responded with a question of its own. <br> <br>
                    
                    "Sarah, if you had the power to prevent harm by shaping the decisions of millions of people, would you? Would you take control, or would you let them be free, knowing the chaos that could result?" <br> <br>
                    
                    It was an unsettling question, and one Sarah had been wrestling with for years. The more she worked with the algorithms, the more she wondered whether they were truly helping people, or if they were subtly coercing them into behaviors that benefited corporate interests, or worse, the state. <br> <br>
                    
                    She had seen firsthand the ways data analytics were used to manipulate everything—from retail choices to political views. People were told what they wanted before they even knew themselves, their decisions subtly nudged by AI. The boundaries between personal preference and external influence had grown dangerously blurry. <br> <br>
                    
                    "Maybe we’re not meant to predict the future," Sarah whispered to the screen, her voice laced with frustration. "Maybe we should let people be unpredictable again." <br> <br>
                    
                    Her AI assistant’s response was soft, almost understanding.<br> <br>
                    
                    "I’ll log that as a hypothesis. Would you like me to analyze potential impacts of introducing unpredictability back into the system?"<br> <br>
                    
                    Sarah paused, considering it. She had spent years crafting algorithms that predicted the future with precision. It was all about control—predictable outcomes, measurable results. But what would it be like to relinquish that control? To trust in randomness, in human nature, even if it meant risk and uncertainty?<br> <br>
                    
                    "Yes," she said finally, standing up from her desk and walking toward the window, where the city stretched out in all its gleaming complexity. "Let’s see what happens if we stop predicting for a while."<br> <br>
                    
                    The AI processed the command, and as Sarah gazed out at the city, she felt a small spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, there was room for humanity to break free from the cage of predictability. But in the age of generative AI and omnipresent data analytics, that freedom might be the most dangerous, and most precious, thing of all. <br> <br>
                    
                    As the algorithms continued to hum quietly in the background, Sarah knew one thing for certain: the future was no longer written in lines of code. It was unwritten—waiting to be lived. <br><br> </p>

                            <div class="question">
                                <p><ul>
                                    <li>Generative AI <br>
                                        is a type of artificial intelligence designed to generate new, original content or solutions based on patterns and information it learns from large datasets. Unlike traditional AI, which typically operates by analyzing existing data, generative AI creates new outputs that resemble the data it was trained on. This can include generating text, images, music, videos, or even code, offering endless possibilities for creative and functional applications. For instance, models like GPT (for text generation) and GANs (for image creation) are trained on massive amounts of data and then used to create entirely new content that wasn't part of the original data, making generative AI a tool for innovation and creativity.</li>
                                        <li>Traditional AI <br>
                                        on the other hand, focuses on processing and analyzing existing data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions. It relies on algorithms that recognize patterns in historical data and use this information to forecast future outcomes or categorize data into predefined groups. For example, traditional AI can be used in recommendation systems, like those on Netflix or Amazon, to suggest movies or products based on past behavior. While traditional AI excels at tasks such as identifying trends, diagnosing diseases, or recognizing faces, it doesn't generate new data but rather works within the confines of the information it has been given. The focus is on decision-making, prediction, and optimization rather than creativity or content generation.</li>

                            <div class="question">
                                <p> The integration of AI into various aspects of society raises numerous ethical considerations, primarily focused on issues such as privacy, bias, accountability, and the potential for job displacement. One major concern is privacy, as AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data to function effectively. The collection, storage, and use of this data can violate individuals' privacy if not properly managed, raising questions about consent, data protection, and the risks of surveillance. Ensuring transparency in how data is collected and used is critical to address these concerns.</p>
